# Citi_Bike_Data

The main purpose of this assignment was to use graphics created in Tableau to visualize bike trip data for a business proposal for a rental bike company in Des Moines, Iowa.  The graphs use data from citibike rentals in New York.

Other visualizations I would use in the future include visualizations in Iowa or surrounding states, graphs comparing rural cities and uraban cities, and using a different month like June or July as the time frame.
